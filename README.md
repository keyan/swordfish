# Swordfish
A chess engine and accompanying user interface written purely in Javascript. Its aquatic name plays tribute to some of the great engines before it (Rybka, Stockfish, Sunfish). Swordfish uses [chessboard.js] to draw board elements and [chess.js] for move validation.

There are clearly issues with the evaluation logic, but we won't be revisting this project.
